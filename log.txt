    WIP on async: 60f6dfa Changed the default.py so that it selects a size from an appropriate distribution.  Used GeometricCamera to shut off logging (memory leak?).  Need to find the memory leak (that was not it). Also added a service to geometricCamera to accommodate different wallSize parameters. Renamed and added LinearModel_Planned_LowLevel (also spits out localtime at end so I can have a sense how long to wait). Added everything I needed to support the wallSize service.  Added ExperimentRunnerSeptember14 which is now the proper runner. It also sets the speed parameter so that I can run it all.  All files should be copied out of their folders when finished into one main folder. All the data on speed and size are in there, making it much easier to read the files (no folder name nonesense).  Need to try updating blender at school and see if morse still run (It should).

    added a stop_rotation to the productions, triggers by the bottom up vision system. the hope is that it will help the funkyness in the large agent where it sometimes misses by a bit... this might delay the rotation stop by a small margin, allowing the agent to rotate extra - fixed a spelling mistake

    New collision sensors made in blender seem better. Not sure why it returns None.  There also seems to be a problem in the productions that ends the simulation a bit too early.  Should add a thing so it waits until the agent is past the aperture.

    As can be seen from the physics, there is a giant red bounding box around the agent. This seems to be causing the early collision detection but its a product of the Collision sensor.... what to do...

    The model works but is unrealistic in its movement. Should consider a complete handoff to the simulator and let the simulator carry it out as async.

    Probably fixed most of it. the two to look at, I think, are _three and _three_alert....  The motor modul stops when it starts rotating.  Also, it should be alerting on the three_fail_alert

    Fixed the logging and multiple running thing.  It adds a file check.ck.  The send_request in Manny returns 1 (because sometimes it returned None, which lead to an infinite loop). The log has been tested.  Morse now resets instead of quits (that's why I need the file). Note that this doesn't put the agent back into the original posture.

    Changed extend_shoulder (and the max mins of shoulder.R).  Added the if for the shoulder.R in and it seems to work better.  Also changed the maximum physics etc to 1 in the default.py. This also makes it update as it is supposed to.  If the framerate drops though, the program will likely crash (hang).  Still need a fix for slow frame rates.

    Going to add a posture system that updates itself with every movement.  This will summarize the details of the body posture into 1 simple chunk set that can be combined with bounding_box and encoded in memory.

    There are still bugs in the vision system but I have a way around it that will work for now.  Ideally this work around will be fixed. Uses _oldopenings if there's a keyError.

    When up close, it doesn't work.  Make sure that when you fint a new object, step INSIDE, then take depth.  When at the edge of an object, step BACK, then take depth.

    There is still some errors when it is really close to the wall. Sometimes those errors are resolved.  I Can't find any bug, however. One idea might be with the depth thing. take 3 readings, one on either side of the actual value. Take the average of the two most similar.

    There is a width estimation and it seems PRETTY accurate. But it does not correspond to the .blend file.  The blend file says the two walls are 8m apart.  The camera says they're 47-48cm apart...  BUT in the simulator, it's near the width of the agent who just barely hits the wall (agent's width with arms down is 44cm). Suggests its CLOSE!
    I need to add a representation to the buffer if an opening is found. I need to add maybe 20% error on the width estimation to account for the perceptual error.

    Replaced screen coordinates for the opening with the keys of the objects for the opening.  Then it should be pretty simple to find the vector to the "objects" which match at a certain Y. The vectors are stored as [4:5].  Just choose the smallest angle, and that's the angle of the opening (A). the distances are (b) and (c), so, just need to calculate for (a)

    More updates. Mostly to the motor module. Each function should take care of what to send to the middleware (like rotate_torso) so that it can handle any ACTR stuff first.  Currently rotate_torso does this properly.  The others should copy as well.

    Fixing the new robot.. should have made a new branch. anyway, arms, legs, torso, all separate armatures

    changed default, added the caravan :) simulator. It shouldn't be too hard to outfit this as a robot

    some minor changes to find_model.py. Need to finish vision request so that it parses the scan output and puts into chunks

    current torso works fine, bounding box works fine. going to fold this branch to master

Author: Sterling <sterlingsomers@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 9 23:27:55 2015 -0500

    Looks like the bounding box calculations are fine. It would be good to refine it so that it's relative to the normal of the objects in question. This will do for the model, though

Author: Sterling <sterlingsomers@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 9 15:45:22 2015 -0500

    The new robot looks like it's complete. The physics seems to account for it. Next will be to re-write the bounding box stuff.

    going to see if I can find another way. This bounding box does not work

Author: Sterling <sterlingsomers@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 5 23:36:07 2015 -0500

    Added a bounding box calculation using meshes on the robot. Still don't know how to figure out if it is forward facing or not. Should add a try to distinguish male from female

Author: Sterling <sterlingsomers@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 5 13:44:44 2015 -0500

    Added methods for finding the edges. These can then be used to find which edges matter. Next commit to find the bounding box dimensions

    added a __getitem__ to model.py to fix the pattern matcher. in pattern.py it was using x=a[key] (line 20). Not sure why this is is but the getitem seems to fix it.

    Things are working again but there are still going to be some actR stuff (like SOS) that aren't working yet. Too bad.

    Going to add ScanBetweenY for when its doing the active. That way it only has to look at approximately shoulder height + minor changes + DM.request does not work

Date:   Thu Dec 4 22:24:32 2014 -0500

    It seems like it's working alright but it's quite slow. At a lower focal length, you might not need numbers so accurate because the image would be zoomed in

    set up the model more accurately. Intention to work on the geometric camera to have a distance sensitive system. Currently model1.py includes a print of the distance to x,y=0.5,0.5 (~10m)

Author: Sterling <sterlingsomers@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 27 22:42:20 2014 -0500

    Made some small changes as I test this branch. Moved the camera forward by a little bit because it seems the camera was also seeing the body of the agent. I also noticed that sometimes that it seems that it crashes, it continues many seconds later. I think I can more or less keep it as is.

Date:   Thu Nov 27 21:18:32 2014 -0500

    A minor change to the model so that the vision occurs int he production cycle. It does not seem to hang when I do that. I'm imaging the issue has to do with threading

    New syncing. Works... better?  It still seems to crash if I use vision...scan() in the loop. It might be the fact that it's in the loop that it crashes, though

    Fixed the geometric camera. Also fixed a small bug in making the queue. Would be a good idea to prioritize requests.

    Worked ont he middle ware to block, etc. Need to test if it's working alright. The output of the current test model is odd. It also gets really slow?

    added async_test2 for torso into the middleware and complied with the toros.default_action. also added async_test2 to the motor module. Did that to test the async stuff, which doesn't seem to work. both commands are received. I'll e-mail about it, but I might have to turn the simulation time up to 1000x, then i can make a best effor system that will run the tick multiple times, clearing the stack. I'll make a branch for that

    test_model.py changed to use the middleware. blenderVision in ccm also uses the middleware. Also fixed GeometricCamera as a re-implementation of semantic camera, with my further functionality. Tested at home.
